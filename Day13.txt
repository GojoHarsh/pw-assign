1. As Array is treated as objects in java the default of array is zero.
2. No we cannot pass the negative number in Array size , because it will     show NegativeArraySizeException.
3.Array is stored inside Heap memory.
4.There are two disadvantages of array:
    (i) We cannot change the size of array at runtime.
    (ii) We cannot add other type of data inside  a particular datatype array.
5.Anonymous array don't have any name and it should be used only once whether you are    passing a string to a method of using it for something else.
    for example:
 class Add{
int add(int a[]){
    int res = 0;
    for ( int b : a )
    {
        res = b + res;
    }
    return res;
}}


class Anony{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       Add ans= new Add();
       int result = ans.add( new int [] {3,56,89,45});
       System.out.println(result);

    }
}

6.We can traverse an array in java by using for loop or enhanced for loop.
7.     Length in java is used to calculate the length of array which means no. of        columns of array in java.
                       for example:     int a[]= {2,3,5,6};
                                              for (int i= 0; i<a.length; i++)
                                                System.out.println(a[i]);
          
     Length() is used to calculate the length of a string.it is a method in string.
