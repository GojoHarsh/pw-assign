1. Programming language is a language through which we instruct a computer to perform our    desired task .
2.Programming makes our work lot more easier because it can perform same task multiple  times without getting tired. For example - if we write a code to convert celcius into  fahreheit and vice versa now it can be used multiple times by any user without  remembering the formula or going through calculation.
3.Some features of java are:
   *First feature of java is that it is very easy to write and readable.
   *It is platform dependent which means if we write a source file of java in windows         platform we can use it on linux as well as mac , the only condition here is jvm interpreter     should be installed on other platform and one more thing jvm is not platform     independent   for every platform there is a different version of jvm but bytecode will     still execute on   them.
   *We can solve real world problems and make real world entity by using java object and     class concept.
4. Object are instance of a class, these are the real world entities which has some    features of them and perform some task. To a create a new object "new" keyword is    used.
5. Classes are the blueprint of how a object will work and what it should have .
6. Main method in java is basically the point from which jvm will start execution of    programs in java , program of main method is written inside the jvm  so it is fixed that    all the programs written in java executes starts its execution from main only.
