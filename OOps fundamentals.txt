1. To create a object in Java we first need to create the blueprint of it by making a class     and then inside main method we we need to use that Class name and a variable name and     then assign that variable a new object by using new keyword.
2.New keyword is used to create new objects in Java.
3.There are three types of variables in Java:
	#Instance variable 
	#Local variable
	#Static variable
4.The main difference between local and instance variable is that local variables are     created inside a method but instance variables are not created inside method.
5.Instance variables are allocated heap memory and local variables get allocated static    memory.
6.Through method overloading one or more method can have same name but its parameter     or datatype should be different.
