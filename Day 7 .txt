1.  Statically typed languages are those in which we have to define which type of data we are storing inside a variable . Example of statically typed language are java, c .
Dynamically typed languages are those in which we don't need to define the type of data we are storing inside a variable it will be automatically assigned during the runtime. Example of Dynamically typed language is python.

2.Variables are the containers in which we store data on which we are going to perfom operation on.
3. To assign a value to a variable we first need to defined its datatype and then we need to give a suitable name  and using '=' this operator we can assign value to variable.
4.These are predefined datatypes provided by programming language  having a perticular assigned to them. The predefined datatypes in java are: byte, short,int,long,  char, float , double, boolean.
5.Identifiers are the name given to variables, classes, objects  in java to recognize them these have to meaningful.
6. Operators in java are :
     '-' used for substraction
     '+' used for addition
     '=' used for assignment
     '++' used for increment
     '--' used for decrement
     '/' used for division
     '%' used for remainder
7.Increment operator is used to increment the value stored in a variable by 1.
 for example: class Increment
                     public static void main(string[]args)
	    { int a = 5;
	     int b = ++a;
                     system.out.println(b);
	     }
output will be 6.
      Decrement operator is used to increment the value stored in a variable by 1.
      class Increment
                     public static void main(string[]args)
	    { int a = 5;
	     int b = --a;
                     system.out.println(b);
	     }
output will be 4.
